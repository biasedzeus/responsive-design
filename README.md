Responsive typography references the viewport to transform text. It does this through media queries, clamp(), or CSS Locks. While these techniques enable granular control of typography across screen sizes, they lack the ability to control typography in different components. This means that, for a page with an array of differently sized content areas, a new headline style would need to be created for each of these areas with a responsive typography approach.

Intrinsic typography doesn’t need all that. With intrinsic typography, a single headline style can be used in all different content areas. Discrete headline styles can be consolidated into one intrinsic headline. This is a distinction similar to that of element queries versus media queries: with element queries it’s possible to bind all of the scaling information to a component, where media queries the styles always reference the viewport.
